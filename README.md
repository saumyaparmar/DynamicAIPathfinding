# AI Pathfinding with Dynamic Obstacles using A* and Flow Field Algorithms

## Abstract

This project presents a dynamic AI pathfinding system developed in Unity, combining multiple AI pathfinding techniques to simulate intelligent and believable agent behaviours. The player character uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate the environment with obstacles on a mouse click. 

Inspired by Asobo Studios’s *A Plague Tale: Innocence*, a rat swarm AI system is implemented using a combination of a single-goal flow field and boid-based local movement behaviours. The rats are attracted to the player—who holds a torch—while avoiding light sources in the environment that act as repulsive dynamic obstacles. When not actively pursuing the player, the rats exhibit natural wandering behaviour algorithms.

This hybrid system demonstrates the effectiveness of blending goal-driven flow fields, local avoidance, and group dynamics with player movement, to create a responsive and immersive AI in real-time game environments exploring different types of AI pathfinding techniques.
